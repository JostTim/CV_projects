# Automated door & gesture triggers
Automated door, with 2 axis linear movement, controlled by two brushed & gear reduced DC motors, and 2 sets of mechanical drives, with HTD timing belts and pulleys.

The door opening is triggered either by pushing one of the 4 endstops, when inside the room, or by **sweeping from left to right** the hand close to the top of the door.

This detection is made possible with the use of an integrated circuit that measures the capacitance between up to 8 channels, and a common reference.

With the use of large enough copper sheets as electrodes, disposed in a linear pattern, one can thus record the movement of objects one one axis, as long as these objects induce a change in capacitance with "antenna" effect, as water does, and the human body containing a large fraction of it, so does it too.
